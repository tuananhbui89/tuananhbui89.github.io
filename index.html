The award is given to those who reviewed four or more papers. In my case, I put considerable effort not only into the initial reviews but also into engaging in discussions with the authors — all with one goal in mind: identifying which aspects of the papers needed to be included or improved. It was neither an easy nor a quick task, requiring several hours just to read and understand each paper, followed by extensive effort during the rebuttal phase (one paper involved a total of 14 back-and-forth exchanges). This all happened while I was also busy in the role of an author myself. In the end, I raised the ratings of 3 out of the 4 papers I reviewed and supported their acceptance and they were indeed accepted! :D I’m glad to see that my efforts were recognized.

While CLIP-based methods for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown promise, they face limitations in target domain generalization due to embedding distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that exploits the geometric relationships between visual and text embeddings through optimal transport theory. By leveraging clustering behavior in multi-modal embeddings and reference predictions from source prompts, our method achieves superior performance in target-prompt learning and representation quality.

<!-- Our movie's story :D

Generative models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can generate impressive, high-quality images with a wide variety of concepts, including undesirable ones like “nudity” or “guns.” These unwanted capabilities of the models can be harmful under the wrong hands, and thus, there is a growing interest in developing methods to unlearn/remove these concepts from the models before they are deployed.

There are two main tasks in concept erasure: (1) removing unwanted concepts and (2) preserving the remaining concepts so that the model's generative capability is not impaired. The first task can be achieved by simply mapping the unwanted concept to a neutral concept such as "a photo" or empty string. Therefore, most existing methods focus on the second task.

Our paper, on the other hand, thinks that the first task has been underrated by the community. We observe the following interesting phenomenons:

- The concept space of a generative model can be represented as a graph like a spiderweb, where each node is a concept and edges are the impact of one concept on the others. When we remove a concept, it’s like dropping a ball into this conceptual spiderweb, triggering a chain reaction. The impact of erasure spreads out, strongly affecting locally related concepts while weakly affecting those further away or unrelated.

- The choice of target concepts is crucial. The “fantastic” targets are those that are locally connected to the concept to be erased but are not its synonyms.

From these observations, we propose a new method to find these optimal targets, leading to near-perfect preservation performance, that even surpasses the performance of our NeurIPS paper. -->
