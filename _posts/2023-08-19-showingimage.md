- Context: I am trying to write blog posts frequently, and sometimes I need to show an image in the post. However, the current Jekyll theme (academicpages) has a problem with showing images. The image can be shown locally but not on the Github page.
  
- Work around: Upload the image to a Github repository and use the link to the raw image in the post. For example, the link to the raw image of my avatar is [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuananhbui89/tuananhbui89.github.io/master/images/utils/Avatar.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuananhbui89/tuananhbui89.github.io/master/images/utils/Avatar.jpg).

- Progress:
  - Learned the difference between {site.baseurl} and {site.url} in Jekyll. Reference: [https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/site-url-baseurl/). They can be set in the `_config.yml` file. In my case, I set `baseurl: ""` and `url: "https://tuananhbui89.github.io"`.
  - View the actual html code of the Github page and found out that the permalink of the post has many subfolders. For example, the original permalink of this post is `/posts/2023/07/learn/learninglog/`, when published, it becomes `https://tuananhbui89.github.io//posts/2023/07/learn/learninglog/`. Therefore, some solutions suggesting that append `../` or `./` to the image path did not work for me. So I changed the permalink to `/blog/learninglog/`.
  - Check case sensitivity of the image path. Refer to this Youtube post: [https://youtu.be/yN7kSfYodnc](https://youtu.be/yN7kSfYodnc).
  - Folder structure of the Github page: 
    - The root folder is `tuananhbui89.github.io`.
    - The `_site` folder is generated by Jekyll and contains the actual html code of the Github page.
    - The `assets` folder contains all the images and other assets.
    - The `blog` folder contains all the blog posts.
    - The `images` folder contains all the images used in the blog posts.
  - Tried with different image paths as follows:

Approach 1:
<!-- ![Avatar](../images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar](../images/utils/Avatar.jpg)`
Can show locally but not on Github page. It is because the image path is relative to the root folder. However, in html code, `<img src="../utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />` is generated, which is not correct.

Approach 2:
<!-- ![Avatar](../../images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar](../../images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Cannot work locally and but on Github page.

Approach 3:
<!-- ![Avatar](./images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar](./images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Cannot work locally and on Github page.

Approach 4:
<!-- ![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/../../images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page but not locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="/../../images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.

Approach 5:
<!-- ![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/./images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/./images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page but not locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="/./images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.

Approach 6:
<!-- ![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/../images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/../images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page but not locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="/../images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.

Approach 7:
![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/utils/Avatar.jpg)
`![Avatar]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page but not locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="/images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.

Approach 8:
<!-- ![Avatar]({{ site.url }}/images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar]({{ site.url }}/images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page but not locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="https://tuananhbui89.github.io/images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.

Approach 9:
<!-- ![Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuananhbui89/tuananhbui89.github.io/master/images/utils/Avatar.jpg) -->
`![Avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuananhbui89/tuananhbui89.github.io/master/images/utils/Avatar.jpg)` Works on Github page and locally (markdown preview). The html code is `<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuananhbui89/tuananhbui89.github.io/master/images/utils/Avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" />`.
