Micromouse competition. 
- First introduced by Claude Shannon in 1950s. 
- At the begining, it was just a simple maze solving competition. However, after 50 years of growing and competing, it has become a very competitive competition with many different categories: speed, efficiency, size. And along with its, many great ideas have been introduced and applied to the competition. It involes many different fields: mechanical, electrical, software, and AI all in just a small robot. 
- The Fosbury Flop in high jump. When everyone use the same jump technique, the performance becomes saturated. Then Fosbury introduced a new technique (backward flop) that no one had ever thought of before. And it became the new standard (even named after him). This phenomenon also happens in the Micromouse competition.
- The two most important game changing ideas in the history of micromouse competition: capability to diagonal movement and using fan (vacumn) to suck the mouse to the path so that the mouse can move faster as in a racing car.

(#F4T) You cannot solve a problem with the same thinking that created it. Albert Einstein. 

Context: Our lab had a workshop last week and Dinh gave a talk about his favorite book "The 7 habits of highly effective people". One of the habits is "Sharpen the saw" means that you always need to improve yourself from all aspects: physical, mental, spiritual, and social. That is the way you can overcome your limits and obstacles that you are facing.  
- You cannot solve a research problem in your thesis with the same knowledge that you have when starting your thesis. You need to grow and learn. 
- If you want to upgrade for your paycheck, you need to learn new skills, new knowledge before applying for a new job. 

(#Experience) The first department metting as a new Research Fellow. 

Context: I have just started my new position as a RF at the Department of Data Science and AI, Monash University. Today is the first time to be exposed to what really happen beyond student's perspective. 
- Teaching matter (because new semester is about to start)   
- Head of departmemt's presentation about current activities (especially hiring and open positions, and budget)
- Ph.D. student recruitment, how competitive it is and how to rank the candidates (some insights: academic record and research record)
