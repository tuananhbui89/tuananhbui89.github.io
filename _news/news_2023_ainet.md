I have been selected as a DAAD AInet fellow for the Postdoc-NeT-AI, specific to Generative Models in Machine Learning. Link  [https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/#Bui](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/fellows/fellows/#Bui)

The fellowship includes

- the participation in the virtual networking week from April 24 to 28 and the associated events,
- the DAAD's financial and organizational support of an individual one-week networking visit to Germany, and
- the membership in the DAAD AInet Fellows and Alumni Network.

Horray! ðŸŽ‰
