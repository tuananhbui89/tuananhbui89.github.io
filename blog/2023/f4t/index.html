      <p>Before talking about the main content - the principles that I have learned and found useful, I want to talk about the principles of this file/blog.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First and foremost, this should be a very personal thing, however, I make it public with purpose - to share with others - who might be interested in me - know about me a little bit more. And for those who does spend time reading this - I appreciate that.</li>
  <li>Second, honest and genuine should be the principle of this blog. I see this blog is a place that I can publicly share: my thoughts, my weaknesses and my growth in professional life. I don’t want you wasting time reading me lieing. Therefore, if something is too personal, it will not be recorded here. And unlike other blogs, I will try to not use AI-assistant to revise (except word suggestions from Cursor because it just pop-up automactically) - a little effort to make it genuine, therefore, you might see more grammar mistakes, but more like a human, more like me.</li>
  <li>Third, reflection and revise. Things change over time, so I will revise this blog post from time to time. The first version of this blog was written in 2023 Aug, and this version is revised on 2025-03-13.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>

<p>My name is Bùi Tuấn Anh with first name: Tuan-Anh (two words) and last name: Bui. But because many people just call me Tuan (which is actually my father name) and I found it also hard for them to pronounce, so I has a another <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">English friendly</code> name: Tony, which actually inspired by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tony Stark</code> - Iron Man :D and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tony</code> Buổi sáng (a famous Vietnamese author - famous for his self-help and inspiration books). So you can just call me Tony.</p>

<p>I am from Vietnam, a country in South East Asia. You might know about my country because of the Vietnam War, but my country is much more than that. You might also know about my country because of Pho or Banh Mi, but again, our food is much more than that.</p>

<p>I am a husband and a father of two sons. And family is the center - the most important thing in my life. Every decision will be made with the highest priority to them.</p>

<p>I got my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Hanoi, Vietnam in a honor program - Chương trình kĩ sư tài năng. I always feel proud and honored to be a part of this program - one of the most prestigious engineering programs in Vietnam. Many of my classmates are very talented and successful in their life. I had also spent a lot of time playing Dota with them in my bachelor.</p>

<p>I got my Doctoral degree in Computer Science from Monash University, Australia. I was fortunate to be supervised by Dinh Phung and Trung Le. My research topics was about Adversarial Robustness for Deep Learning Models.</p>

<p>I am currently working as a Research Fellow (a.k.a. Postdoc) at Monash University. Now I am working in the intersection between Generative Models and Trustworthy Machine Learning. I investigate and develop methods to make Generative Models more trustworthy and less harmful.</p>

I am not good at **saying no**.

I am not good at **holding my emotions**. -->

<!-- ## My Failures

It is not an easy decision to share my failures publicly here. But because many of the people reading this blog are the ones who might be interested in hiring me :D, therefore, I make a very straight message: I have failed many times but I am the one who will learn from that fast :D.

**Reject from an US startup on defense - Melbourne office - 2025**

**Reject from a big tech specializing in enterprise software, cloud, etc. - Remote in Australia- 2025** This is one of the most painful rejection recently. I really like the company (many Vietnamese work there, including my labmate) and the job. They develop a LLM-powered assistant for Healthcare, that has very high impact. But sadly, because of my lack experience in LLM, I was rejected. Because I spent too much time to prepare for the interview, I decide to write [a series of blog posts](https://tuananhbui89.github.io/blog/2025/llm-series/) to share what I learned along the way here.The interview process has several rounds, including:

- 1 short chat with HR and Hiring manager.
- 1 technical scanning covering: Machine learning, Deep learning, NLP and LLM.
- 1 loop interview with: 
  - 1 coding interview: code a random sampling function - with unbalanced input, and a word search problem. At that time, I could not solve with the optimal solution - Trie.
  - 1 - 24 hours take-home challenge: I was given a problem to investigate robustness of LLMs like llamma 3-1, Qwen, etc on a specific dataset. I had to work all night - 24 hours straight - on that problem. But sadly, because of my lack experience in LLM, I could not try/apply the best jail-break attacks on that dataset. After that, I wrote the blog [here](https://tuananhbui89.github.io/blog/2025/llm-jailbreak/) to share my experience/learn.
  - 1 system design interview: I was asked to design a system for providing conversational answer for API requests. I learned some components of the system before, like RAG, SFT, RLHF, etc. But in the interview, I messed up.
  - 1 hiring manager interview
  - 1 behavioral interview

**Reject from a popular social media company - Sydney office - 2024** I made to the second round and got rejected because could not answer the ["Number of Islands"](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/) question. After that, I tried to write [this blog]() to learn more about Leetcode problems.

**Reject from a big tech specializing in CRM - Remote in Australia - 2024** I believe that I was rejected because of my English and just messed up the interview (behavioral questions).

**Reject from an Australian tech company - developing vision systems for cars - Canberra office - 2024** There are two rounds. The first round is a technical interview - they asked me about some of my previous works, including my SAM paper. I was asked about why SAM can he -->

<!-- ## Goals

Starting from 2025, Mar, I will try to record my goals and aspirations over time.

- 2025:
  - Write blog more often. I always feel that I achieve something whenever I publish a new blog post. The blog also helps me to organize and feel more productive.
  - Scale my research - learn how to mentor someone else. I think I am in a stage that I can have multiple good ideas that should work and be a good contribution.
  - Find a more secure job. The current one is great, I am doing what I think important (Trustworthy Generative Models) and I am also good at (align with my past experience). The collaborators are also great. However, something has just been changed. In the past, I also had more freedom in this job, e.g., freedom to collaborate with others. I am also not confident in my ability to get a lecturer position in near future(extremely competitive in Australia - IMO). -->

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p>I always feel that I am too busy and do not have enough time to do what I want. As a father of two very active boys, I always feel that they need me to play with them, to teach them something useful, or just to be with them.
But because I am also at early-stage of my career, who still struggle to find a secure job - struggle to find a direction - struggle to proof my value, I always feel that I have to work more.
I try to not compare myself with others, and understand that everyone have different situations/conditions/circumstances, but everytime, when I see others having a successful career (a FAANG job, a lecturer position, a owner of a coffee shop), I feels depressed and feel that I am not trying hard enough.</p>

<p>Therefore, one of the things I try to learn and reflect often is about how to be more productive. I watched many videos - of that kind - like those from Ali Abdaal - in the past. I also follow several inspiration people - like Naval Ravikant - in Twitter.
But I found that watching or reading too much is not helpful. Sometimes, just stick to few principles but always remember them and try to apply them is enough.</p>

<p>Below are some principles that I try to follow.</p>

<!-- **Family first**

- I choose to study in Australia, got my PhD, and work here because of my family.
- Currently I do not consider to find a job in other countries rather than Australia because of my family.
- It is okay to sometimes work hard, work late, i.e., running for a deadline. Sometimes, I need to sacrifice family to keep the job - to keep them fed and secured (so please give me a job :D). But it's not okay to keep doing that for too long. Overall, family is the one who remembers me the most but not the company. -->

<h2 id="ideas">Ideas</h2>

<p>One of the things that I think I am good at is “head on the clouds” - having a lot of (mostly not realistic) ideas. Back in the time when I was a student, I even want to change my major to Marketing because I thought I was good at having ideas to sell things :D.
Even now, I still have a lot of ideas, not just about research but also about business, startups, that I sometimes consider to quit my job to pursue them :D. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I do not have enough bravery - or confidence - to do that.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180505190115/http://www.veronikach.com/how-i-fail/how-i-fail-ian-goodfellow-phd14-computer-science/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a talk from Ian Goodfellow</a> (a very famous researcher - GAN’s creator), one time he said that “he has a lot of ideas, but most of them do not see the light of day”. I don’t know why but his words always stuck in my head.
When having an idea, I spend a lot of time, effort and energy to at least think about it, make it more concrete.
But then, most of them just stay in my notebooks, under a table or in some corners of my computer and never see the light of day.
Just a waste of time! Sometimes, I revisit them, most of research ideas are just silly - or out of date, but several still very interesting and give me an emotion.</p>

<p>Therefore, I will try to record and share some of my ideas here. It can be a risk that it is a million dollar idea or a potential research topic, that someone can steal it.
But I believe that “Ideas come often, execution is more important” and “sharing first, getting later” and make the use of my time and energy.
Finally, if you just read that far, you are deserved to have a good laugh :D - reading my silly ideas :D.</p>

<p>(I will gradually add more ideas here)</p>

<p><strong>Unlearning LLMs</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Topic: Generative Models; Trustworthy Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Date: 2025-03-14</li>
  <li>Description:
    <ul>
      <li>I wrote a blog post about the Unlearning LLMs here: <a href="https://tuananhbui89.github.io/blog/2025/unlearn-llms/">link</a>
</li>
      <li>After reading these papers, I have several follow-up ideas (briefly mentioned here) (1) Data-centric unlearning - filtering out the irrelevant data from retain set (2) Create a retain set from forget set (3) The role of random target in unlearning.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Multi-Objective Optimization for Unlearning - Dealing with gradient conflict</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Topic: Generative Models; Trustworthy Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Date: 2025-03-14</li>
  <li>Description:
    <ul>
      <li>This idea came after our NeurIPS 2024 paper. The standard unlearning objective consists of two terms: the forget loss and the retain loss.</li>
      <li>They might have conflict in direction, e.g., evidence by the drop in performance of the unlearned model on the retain set.</li>
      <li>We proposed a multi-objective optimization framework (i.e., PCGrad) to deal with this problem.</li>
      <li>We can also consider it as an additional constraint to choose the optimal retain set.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Better Closed-Form Solution for Unlearning</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Topic: Generative Models; Trustworthy Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Date: 2025-03-14</li>
  <li>Description:
    <ul>
      <li>There are two main approaches to unlearning: (1) Output-based unlearning: mapping the output with \(c_e\) to output with \(c_t\) - where our NeurIPS 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers belong to(2) Attention-based unlearning: mapping the attention output with \(c_e\) to attention output with \(c_t\) - where TIME, UCE are two representative methods.</li>
      <li>I wrote a blog post about the two approaches here: <a href="https://tuananhbui89.github.io/blog/2024/erasing-concepts/#unified-concept-editing-in-diffusion-models">link</a>
</li>
      <li>I have listed current limitations of the two approaches in the blog post.</li>
      <li>One of the limitations is the invertibility issue if we don’t have the preserved/retained data. The current solution is to add \(d\) additional presevations along the canonical basis vectors.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>I have a year-3 son and recently, he needs to prepare for his NAPLAN test at school.</li>
      <li>The free NAPLAN practice samples are very limited. Only available from year 2012-2016, that can just be finished in several hours.</li>
      <li>We - A typical Asian family - want my son to practice more and prepare better for his test.</li>
      <li>I think - with the current stage of LLM - we can leverage the model to generate quite a lot of similar questions to practice!</li>

<p><strong>Safety Checker - The simple and efficient way to deal with NSFW content</strong></p>

  <li>Description:
    <ul>
      <li>I wrote a blog post about the Safety Checker in Stable Diffusion here: <a href="https://tuananhbui89.github.io/blog/2024/safety-checker/">link</a>
</li>
      <li>While Machine Unlearning is a interesting and fascinating research topic, I think from a business perspective, updating the Safety Checker is more practical and useful, when the model is already deployed and we need to deal with the new NSFW queries.</li>
      <li>More specifically, because the (current) Safety Checker is just a alignment model, where we have a pair of text and image encoder to measure the similarity between the key words - that we want to ban/filter - and the generated image. Therefore, it can be updated very easily when we have a new set of key words to ban/filter.</li>
      <li>We can also think about a new research direction starting from this setting: how to make the Safety Checker more efficient and effective.</li>

<p><strong>Football Minimap Prediction</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Topic: Business</li>
  <li>Date: 2018</li>
  <li>Description:
    <ul>
      <li>This is very old idea back in 2018 when I was in Singapore and first time explored to GAN. Back then, I was so excited with Pix2Pix model and its ability to learn the transformation from domain A to domain B, and thought that it can be applied to this problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Motivation</strong></p>

<p>Currently, the Football TV audiences do not know location of players who not in the current camera frame. Therefore they might has not the full experience as spectators are watching live on the stadium. We can have some simple solutions for this problem, such as using another camera to shoot he entire football field, or using statistical data from the chip attached to the players. However, from the perspective of computer vision engineer, I propose one more solution for the this problem (might be not a good choice but just for fun:), in which I use the GAN model to create a minimap from a camera frame as in the FIFA or PES football video game.</p>

    A sample of a frame from a game in Youtube where the minimap is there for better experience
</div>

<p>In the case of players in the frame, I use the GAN model (Image 2 Image Translation) to learn the transformation from the player’s position in the frame to the position of the player in the minimap.</p>

<p>In the case of players are not in the current frame: I use [?] to predict a current positions of the players from the previous positions and their trajectory (or you might hope GAN as one size fit all model which can learn not only the current frame but also the invisible players)</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>

<p>Because the real matches on TV don’t have a minimap therefore I use the alternative sources there are FIFA18 and PES18 video on Youtube. Then I do some preprocess to collect and clean data.</p>

<p>Step 1: Cut only the frames which have the minimap within. Because in those videos, it’s not only normal frame (which has a minimap) but also spotlight or review or something else. Therefore I have to manually select the period of time in which there are only normal frames. I sample with the sample rate as 2 frames per second</p>

    Bad examples: minimap has overlap by line or player within
</div>

<p>After 3 steps as above, I have two sets: The camera frame set (with noised minimap) and the minimap set. I will chose camera frame set as a Source and minimap as a Target for Pix2Pix model. (You can swap 2 source and have enjoy the interesting result, in which we can render a camera frame from a minimap). Then I do a preprocessing to have a better dataset for training.</p>

<p>Because the football video game knows locations of not only players in camera frame but also all of players in the game. Therefore it can create a completed minimap that has the locations of all players. TV audiences who have only camera frame cannot do that. They only infer the position of players who are in camera frame, and cannot infer remaining players. Based on this intuition, I improve the model by doing crop the active window in minimap as follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Localize position of the ball (usually has yellow-color in minimap)</li>
  <li>Crop roughly 1/2 width of minimap (1/4 in the left of ball and 1/4 in the right of ball)</li>
  <li>Keep the height</li>
</ul>

<p>I realize that audience change in each frame, and they might made a huge noise to model, which cause training more difficult. Moreover, players is really small in whole frame, and grass is not stable in each frame or each game, therefore, similar to audience, they might lead a huge noise to model. Therefore I design a filter to filter them from a Camera frame using Color Threshold App in Matlab.</p>

<p>Difficulties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pix2Pix model has demonstrated its ability to learn the transformation from domain A to domain B as shown in the paper: Day to night, BW to Color, Aerial to Map. However, in those cases, 2 domain are not too much different. In this case, we need a transformation from 2 completely different domains. It also needs a transformation from 2D - 2D matching in abstract level (model need to know each player is correspond to each circle in minimap). Therefore, it will be very challenge to learn</li>
  <li>The difference between a Video Game Frame and a Real Camera Frame.</li>
  <li>Dataset too small and noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this problem is difficult even humans, but it is worth to try and see what the GAN can do.
<strong>Revised in 2025</strong>: I think the idea of generating minimap is still interesting and might be more realistic with the current stage of Generative Models.</p>
