      <p>This is a collection of principles in work, finance, and life that I have learned and implemented. <strong>Not</strong> something deep (I am not a deep thinker), but just some simple principles that I find useful for me.</p>

<!-- ## Implemented

### 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen Covey

These are the habits that I learned from Dinh - my supervisor, who is known by our Falculty as "obsessed" with this book :smile:. I have seen him talking about these habits several times in different occasions with full of passion and enthusiasm. Not only that, I have also seen him applying these habits and sometimes explains to me why the reason under his decision - which is based on his core values that he has defined for himself. This is the reason leading me to read this book and apply these habits in my life. -->

<h3 id="there-is-a-space-between-what-happens-to-you-and-how-you-react-to-it">There is a space between what happens to you and how you react to it</h3>

<p>Victor Frankl said, “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”</p>

<p>Your actions are a result of your choice. You can’t blame other people or any other than yourself for your actions.</p>

<p>You have to be proactive, not reactive.</p>

<h3 id="begin-with-the-end-in-mind">Begin with the end in mind</h3>

<p>Think about what you can achieve if you put your effort into it.</p>

<p>If you do not work on important problems, then it is obvious you have little chance of doing important things. (Richard Hamming, You and Your Research)</p>

<h3 id="put-first-things-first">Put first things first</h3>

<p>We all have 24 hours a day. The difference is how we use it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important and urgent: Deadlines, what you do for living, etc.</li>
  <li>Important but not urgent: Learning, improving yourself, building relationships, etc. Allocate time for these things.</li>
  <li>Not important but urgent</li>
  <li>Not important and not urgent</li>
  <li>If something you can complete it in 5 minutes, do it now.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="less-is-more">Less is More</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Example 1: When tutoring in Deep Learning Unit, sometimes I feel hard to explain all the content in one lab session. Several times, I tried to just go through all the content quickly and then let the students do the lab by themselves. However, I found that with this approach the students did not understand much and were not interested in the lab. Then I tried to explain less content but in more details, which was more effective.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="find-a-pattern-that-works-and-repeat-it">Find a pattern that works and repeat it</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t make things complicated, don’t wait to be perfect, just repeat what works.<br>
Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Example 1: I find myself more productive when I write this blog. It provides me a platform to organize my thoughts, log what I have learned and reflect myself. So I will try to write more often.</li>
</ul>

<!-- - Example 2: Wake up early, write code or blog or do one leetcode problem, then go to swimming, then go back home and prepare my son for school. This is my morning routine since August 2023. I find it very effective and I will try to keep this routine.
- Example 3: Log progress in practicing leetcode problems. I find out that write a [blog post](https://tuananhbui89.github.io/projects/project_75_leetcode_questions/) about leetcode with the help of Github Copilot is a very good way to learn coding.
For example, when I try to solve the ["104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree"](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/) problem, when I type the problem's description Github Copilot promptly suggests me the exact description of the problem. Moreover, when I try to write the code, Github Copilot also suggests me the perfect solution. When I don't know about some details, e.g., DFS, I just create a blockquote with prompt "What is DFS?" and Github Copilot suggests me the answer. -->

<h3 id="put-things-in-context-see-from-different-perspectives">Put things in context, see from different perspectives</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Example 1: When seeing a financial advice in YouTube (e.g., like <a href="https://youtu.be/UzBMiikbKuA?si=3b89Eq8qds74sSiw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this</a>), think about the context of the advice. Is it applicable to your situation, your country, your age, your financial situation, risk tolerance, your financial goal? Also try to see from different perspectives. And to be able to do that, you need to grasp diverse knowledge and experience (i.e., <a href="https://fs.blog/munger-worldly-wisdom/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wordly Wisdom</a> proposed by Charlie Munger). The perspective also can be a view from different people (similar as the principle “Seek first to understand, then to be understood” in the book “7 habits of highly effective people” by Stephen Covey).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="you-are-not-what-you-did-you-are-what-you-did-repeatedly">You are not what you did, you are what you did repeatedly</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Single failure in the past does not define you.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="working-with-attention-is-all-you-need-copy-from-lucidrains">Working with attention is all you need (copy from <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lucidrains</a>)</h3>

<h3 id="idea-is-cheap-execution-is-expensive">Idea is cheap, execution is expensive</h3>

<!-- ## Learned -->

<!-- ### Some ideas/concepts from Charlie Munger

(Sorry, this is not my original content, but I forgot where I got it from.) -->

<h3 id="knowing-what-you-dont-know-is-more-useful-than-being-brilliant">Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant</h3>

<p>Most people spend their lives wrestling with the consequences of poor decisions. But the truth is it’s much easier to avoid stupidity than try to be smart.</p>

<p>Admit you know nothing. Remove ego from the equation.</p>

<!-- **“A majority of life’s errors are caused by forgetting what one is really trying to do.”**

We set goals, pursue them, then get distracted.

To achieve something meaningful, you need to constantly correct course.

Set a north star and keep it front of mind. -->

<!-- **“Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.”**

If you do the same as everyone else, you’ll get the same results. 

But most people are:
• Unhappy
• Unfulfilled
• Unmotivated

Following society’s standards traps you in them.

Be bold. Go against the grain. -->

<!-- **“To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.”**

Naval once said the world is an efficient place.

You can’t control results, but you can control your:
· Character
· Work ethic
· Willingness to learn

Earn what you want. -->

<!-- **“The fundamental algorithm of life – repeat what works.”**

It’s easy to overcomplicate success.

But the truth is everything you do creates feedback. Smart people listen.

When something goes poorly, do less.

When something goes well, do it much more. -->

<!-- **“Those who keep learning, will keep rising.”**

Most people stop learning at 18. Munger is still going at 98.

Knowledge is an asset that compounds over time. 

The more you know, the better you think. Better choices, great consequences. 

Schedule time to study. -->

<!-- **“You don’t have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long time.”**

Berkshire Hathaway is valued at \$991.89 billion.

Buffet and Munger’s approach?

Rationality and patience.

It isn’t a sexy approach, but the results sure as hell are. -->

<h3 id="the-best-thing-a-human-being-can-do-is-help-another-human-being-know-more">The best thing a human being can do is help another human being know more</h3>

<p>The best way to live your life is in service to other people. Especially now with the online opportunities.</p>

<p>Be generous with your ideas. Share what you know and help others win.</p>

<!-- **“We insist on a lot of time being available almost every day to just sit and think.”**

We live at a time of constant input. Everyone wants to maximise every moment for productivity.

But life is cause and effect.

Decisions are the key to success. Time to think is the priority. -->

<!-- **“You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely.”**

Principles from:
· Maths
· Physics
· Biology
· Philosophy
· Engineering

All have a profound impact on life.

Study mental models. Build a toolkit. Treat your mind like your greatest asset. -->

<!-- ### [How to get rich (without getting lucky) by Naval Ravikant](https://mcdonnellcallum.medium.com/naval-ravikant-how-to-get-rich-without-getting-lucky-e8d32bba14d1)

Some I like with my current knowledge and experience:

- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.
- Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.
- About specific knowledge:
  - Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.
  - When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.
  - Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.
- Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work. -->
