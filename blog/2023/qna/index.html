      <p>This is a collection of questions and answers. The questions are from Internet, interviews, or my own thoughts. The answers are mostly from my own perspective and understanding. It is inspired by my supervisor Dinh, who has a excellent capability of asking questions and answering them. I think self-reflection is the key to unlock this capability that leads me to this collection.</p>

<!-- Some questions are really personal which I am really embarrassed to share. -->

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Why do you want to do research?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What do you want to do next? after PhD?</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you have to organize a reading group about a new topic (e.g., Multimodal learning) what will you do? (asked in an interview)</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is your most catastrophic/costly failure and what did you learn from it? (asked in an interview)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time when you had a confliction with your supervisor on a project and how did you resolve it? (asked in an interview)</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to engage with clients, supervisors, and colleagues?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time when you had an obstacle in your research and how did you overcome it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Why do you want to do research in our group? Why do you want to do this project?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are you a researcher or an engineer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is the difference between a good researcher and a great researcher?</strong></p>

<p>A good researcher is someone who can push the field forward a little bit. A great researcher is someone who can hold the whole field back for several years. (a half-joke answer by Prof. Truyen Tran as I remember).</p>

<p>A great researcher is someone who has his own research agenda and can inspire others to follow his agenda. He will not be affected by the trend, but just focus on his own idea and (slowly) prove that his idea is right (or wrong).</p>

<h2 id="behavioral-questions">Behavioral questions</h2>

<p><strong>How do you respond when you disagree with a coworker?</strong>
<strong>Tell me about a time you dealt with conflict on a team. How did you solve it?</strong></p>

<p>Situation: While working on a computer vision project for ID photo verification back then when I was a research engineer at Trusting Social, I encountered a technical disagreement with my supervisor regarding the approach to detect glare in photos. My supervisor advocated for traditional image processing methods, while I believed a deep learning approach would be more effective.</p>

<p>Task: I needed to develop a reliable module for glare detection in ID photos while maintaining a good working relationship with my supervisor and ensuring the best technical solution was implemented.</p>

<p>Action:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented both approaches in parallel to compare their performance objectively</li>
  <li>Developed a simple CNN model as a proof of concept</li>
  <li>Collected comprehensive test data to evaluate both methods</li>
  <li>Prepared a detailed presentation comparing the results, including accuracy metrics and example cases</li>
  <li>Professionally presented my findings to my supervisor, acknowledging the merits of both approaches</li>
</ul>

<p>Result: The CNN model significantly outperformed the traditional thresholding method, achieving higher accuracy and robustness. My supervisor appreciated the data-driven approach to resolving our disagreement and approved the deep learning solution. This experience strengthened our working relationship and established a precedent for resolving technical disputes through empirical evidence.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you failed at work. How did you deal with it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p>I was working on a collaborative project with Australia’s Department of Defence’s DSTG and had completed a research paper for submission to WACV, a top computer vision conference. Due to the sensitive nature of the work, the paper required DSTG approval before it could be submitted.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>My job was to ensure the paper received approval and was submitted before the conference deadline, while strictly adhering to DSTG’s security protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I followed the standard procedure and submitted the paper for approval, expecting the usual two-week review timeline.</li>
  <li>When delays began to occur, I regularly followed up to check on the approval status.</li>
  <li>After realizing we couldn’t meet the first submission deadline, I decided to wait for the second submission round and prepared the paper for submission as soon as approval came through.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The paper was submitted in the second round and received generally positive reviews with minor, easily addressable feedback.</li>
  <li>Unfortunately, the second round did not include a rebuttal phase, and the paper was ultimately rejected.</li>
  <li>This experience taught me several valuable lessons, such as starting the approval process much earlier for sensitive projects, being more proactive in seeking guidance from senior collaborators, exploring alternative submission options like abstract submissions, and better planning around institutional requirements for future submissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the paper wasn’t accepted, I used these insights to improve my approach for future collaborations, ensuring smoother submission processes in later projects.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about an interesting project you’ve worked on recently.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Situation:</strong></p>

<p>I recently worked on a project to develop an erasure method for removing unwanted concepts, like nudity or guns, from foundation models, particularly Text-to-Image Diffusion Models. These models are being widely used in real-world applications, and the risk of misuse is a real concern. This project felt meaningful to me because of its potential to address a serious societal issue.</p>

<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>

<p>The goal was to create a simple yet effective method to remove these unwanted concepts while making sure the approach could be practically applied. Along the way, I wanted to contribute to the research community by sharing my learnings and helping others working on similar problems.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong></p>

<p>To tackle this, I:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dived into research: I did a thorough literature review to get up to speed on existing work. To make the process more efficient (and useful for others), I wrote a blog post summarizing my findings.</li>
  <li>Documented challenges: While testing and implementing other methods, I kept track of the challenges I faced and shared those online. It helped me stay organized and provided useful insights for others in the field.</li>
  <li>Built and refined a method: After understanding the gaps, I developed a new approach that turned out to be both simple and very effective.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result:</strong></p>

<p>In just a year, I managed to publish three papers on this topic, and one of them was accepted at NeurIPS 2024. I’m proud of this project because it not only solved a practical problem but also opened up interesting insights into how erasing one concept impacts others. Plus, it showed I could handle a fast-paced and impactful project successfully!</p>

<p><strong>Tell me about a time you faced a really hard problem / a challenge at work</strong></p>

<p><strong>Situation/Task:</strong> I want to develop a theoretical framework to understand why and how personalization methods can learn from reference images.
My hypothesis is that each image has a combination of personal features (such as your specific hairstyle, face shape, eye color, etc.) and generic features (such as the background, context around you, etc.). The current approach is just simply learning the mean/center of the personal features in the latent space. While it looks simple, but it comes with many implications and intuitions, for example,</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there are two people in the training set, the learned code is the average of the two, or might represent both of them.</li>
  <li>If there is not variance in the personal features, the learned code is also less variance, meaning that you cannot generate different styles/views of that person.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I don’t have a solid background in mathematics. I have intuition about the problem, the final result, but I don’t know the path to get there.</p>

<p><strong>Action:</strong> I believe in the principle that “the luck comes to prepared mind”. I indicated the gap in the problem and waited for the opportunity to fill it.
It helped me to navigate when reading papers, and anchor my thoughts around the problem whenever I read a new paper. Such as, “Does this paper fill the gap?”</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Until now, I still don’t find the exact solution to the problem, but I have a pretty good pathway to get there, inspired by another paper from CMU.</p>
