<!-- Our movie's story :D

Generative models like Stable Diffusion or DALL-E can generate impressive, high-quality images with a wide variety of concepts, including undesirable ones like “nudity” or “guns.” These unwanted capabilities of the models can be harmful under the wrong hands, and thus, there is a growing interest in developing methods to unlearn/remove these concepts from the models before they are deployed.

There are two main tasks in concept erasure: (1) removing unwanted concepts and (2) preserving the remaining concepts so that the model's generative capability is not impaired. The first task can be achieved by simply mapping the unwanted concept to a neutral concept such as "a photo" or empty string. Therefore, most existing methods focus on the second task.

Our paper, on the other hand, thinks that the first task has been underrated by the community. We observe the following interesting phenomenons:

- The concept space of a generative model can be represented as a graph like a spiderweb, where each node is a concept and edges are the impact of one concept on the others. When we remove a concept, it’s like dropping a ball into this conceptual spiderweb, triggering a chain reaction. The impact of erasure spreads out, strongly affecting locally related concepts while weakly affecting those further away or unrelated.

- The choice of target concepts is crucial. The “fantastic” targets are those that are locally connected to the concept to be erased but are not its synonyms.

From these observations, we propose a new method to find these optimal targets, leading to near-perfect preservation performance, that even surpasses the performance of our NeurIPS paper. -->

                    Excited to share another paper that I am very proud of. This paper is an extension of our NeurIPS 2024 paper, where we dive deeper into the impact of erasing one concept to the others, but this time, we focus on the choice of target concepts. The paper can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. Our paper’s name was inspired by the movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”</a>. Hopefully, the reviewers enjoy it as much as the movie <img class="emoji" title=":joy:" alt=":joy:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f602.png" height="20" width="20">.

We had a challenging rebuttal period, where we worked hard to address the feedback from some tough but silent reviewers. Fortunately, we had other reviewers who actively engaged with us, sought to understand our paper, and ultimately championed it. So, in this happy moment, I want to express my gratitude to the anonymous reviewers ❤️, as well as to my incredible collaborators from Monash and DST. We will soon update the paper with all the details and code.

The project will focus on various aspects of Trustworthy Generative Models, including alignment, safety, and robustness. This project is not only the first major grant on Generative AI in our DSAI department but also across the entire FIT at Monash University. 🎉 🎉 🎉
