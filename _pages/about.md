I am a Ph.D. student at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Dinh Phung](http://dinhphung.ml/) and [Dr. Trung Le](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gysdMxwAAAAJ&hl=en).  My research interests are Adversarial Machine Learning (i.e., understanding ML models's behaviour and making them more robust against the changing of data) and Representation Learning (i.e., how to learn/disentangle a more meaningful/robust latent representation which can benefit downstream tasks).

Before that, I had one year working as Research Engineer at Credit AI Lab, Trusting Social, and two years working as Research Assistant at Singapore University of Technology and Design with [Prof. Ngai Man Cheung](https://sites.google.com/site/mancheung0407/) and [Dr. Trung Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9SE3GYMAAAAJ&hl=en).

*I am completing my Ph.D. study and actively looking for an opportunity for either Postdoc or Research Engineer. Please refer to [my CV](files/TuanAnhBui_CV.pdf) and reach out if you think I am a good fit.*
