I am Research Fellow at the Department of Data Science and AI, Monash University, working with [Prof. Dinh Phung](http://dinhphung.ml/) and [Dr. Trung Le](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gysdMxwAAAAJ&hl=en). I am still a Ph.D. student at the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, waiting for the thesis examination. My research interests are Adversarial Machine Learning (i.e., understanding ML models's behaviour and making them more robust against the changing of data) and Generative Models (i.e., GAN, VAE and Diffusion Models).

Before that, I had one year working as Research Engineer at Credit AI Lab, Trusting Social, and two years working as Research Assistant at Singapore University of Technology and Design with [Prof. Ngai Man Cheung](https://sites.google.com/site/mancheung0407/) and [Dr. Trung Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9SE3GYMAAAAJ&hl=en).

*I am completing my Ph.D. study and actively looking for an opportunity for either Postdoc or Research Engineer. Please refer to [my CV](assets/pdf/TuanAnhBui_CV.pdf) and reach out if you think I am a good fit.*
